    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an aspiring software developer currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science at VIT-AP University. With a strong foundation in C and C++, and a solid grasp of data structures and algorithms, I've developed a deep appreciation for the logic and efficiency behind code.<br><br>
      As part of my learning journey, I'm exploring the fields of machine learning, data analytics, and statisticsâ€”primarily using Python and SQL. These areas allow me to combine analytical thinking with practical problem-solving to extract insights and build intelligent solutions.<br><br>
      I'm deeply driven by the principle of first-principles thinking, which helps me break down complex problems into their fundamental components. I believe in continuous learning, building from the ground up, and creating solutions that are not just functional, but impactful.

  This project presents a comprehensive analysis of biomedical parameter extraction using the MAX30102 sensor.<br><br>
  It explores the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations behind the extraction of vital health metrics including heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate variability (HRV), perfusion index, and respiratory rate.<br><br>
  The implementation is based on the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling real-time signal processing and cloud connectivity through Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for efficient data storage and transmission.<br><br>
  The goal of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of creating a robust, non-invasive health monitoring system suitable for both clinical and personal use.<br><br>
  By leveraging optical PPG signals captured via red and infrared light, the project effectively extracts and processes cardiovascular and respiratory signals in a compact embedded system.<br><br>
  This approach contributes to the growing domain of wearable health technology and remote patient monitoring systems.
